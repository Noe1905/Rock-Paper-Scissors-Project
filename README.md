# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project

In this project, I will showcase my foundational JavaScript skills by building a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user competes against the computer. Initially, the game will operate entirely in the console. In the future, I plan to enhance it with interactive elements to improve user experience.
